This project is about the creation of a Python module to convert the output file of EUMETSAT's Geostationary Surface Albedo (GSA) to the HDF5 format.

GSA output files are saved in a binary native format and this project aims to convert them to the popular HDF5 format so that they can be easily manipulated with HDF5 reding software.

The code is now mostly complete. Since the main purpose of this module is the integration within IM's processing lines, further development will be incorporated with the rest of the code. The decoding may be of interest to others though.
